# Nodejs Weather App

Setting up of express server, experimenting with serving up static html files and assets. I have since switched to using handlebars for creating dynamic templates.

Working with various express methods such as `app.get()`, `app.set()`, `app.use()` and more.

Eventually becoming a simple web app that provides weather forecast in the browser.
