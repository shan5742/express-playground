# Nodejs Weather App

Setting up of express server, experimenting with serving up static html files and assets. I have since switched to using handlebars for creating dynamic templates.

Working with various express methods such as `app.get()`, `app.set()`, `app.use()` and more.

The end product is a simple weather app that can be accessed via a browser, to show a basic forecast from a location input.

Styling and feature rich was not the goal here. Maybe when I have time I can iterate over this to add more details to the weather and make things look a lot nicer, but the goal of this project for me was to become more familiar with node and express.
